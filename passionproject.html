                Project for stakeholder and companies who are searching for
                an ICT business. For this project, I need to show what this
                business can do for other businesses in the ICT. I do this
                with a website so I can show what services they give and who
                they are.
                <br /><br />
                For this website, my stakeholder recommended me to do some
                research for frameworks. He also uses these frameworks in his
                projects and upcoming business. For these frameworks I did
                research on the websites of the frameworks itself and just
                experimented in the project. For me it was an easy way to learn
                because it is very logical in use. For tailwind, there are all
                documents of showing how to use it, so it is very easy to find
                what I need. With nextjs, you start with a page that is already
                made, so in that way I looked how the structure was and I
                adjusted this to what I needed, so this was also an easy way to
                start with this.
