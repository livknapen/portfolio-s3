                    By creating a good product for our stakeholder, we have

                    good idea of ​​what appeals to our audience. This also
                    allowed us to conduct good surveys to get in touch with this
                    audience.

                    For every project I made a concept document to know what the

                    make for our stakeholder. This also allows me to document
                    every detail of what my projects are about. I think it is a
                    good way to know what the whole projects are aboutt.

                    For my projects, I made different designs. From websites to

                    and inspiration, and with the feedback I received on
                    different products, I could improve the designs. With doing
                    this proces, I could make good designs along with strong
                    arguments as to why I made something this way.

                    To get a good idea of what the Voting Guide website would
