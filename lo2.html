                    For all my projects with a website, I created a Gitlab to
                    document my coding and for pushing it online. I find it
                    useful to use so that my projects can be online and
                    accessible to the teachers. I can also keep track of what I
                    push and with collaboration we can view each other's code.

                    live on the localhost. Also, to see how my folder structure

                    To work as a group in a project on Git, it is very useful to
                    use branches, this allows you to prevent merges without
                    losing all the code. A branch has been created for each page
                    where everyone can push and commit their own code so that it
                    is online for the entire group. Ultimately, you can merge
                    all branches into the main branch and get the entire website
                    working without having to do too many merge requests.

                    For all my projects, I did code documentation (the green
                    text) to easily see what this code beneath is about. For
                    people who want to copy my code, this also makes it easy to
                    find what they want to adjust or view. Since I have also
                    worked with a group, this is useful for everyone to use and
                    see how the code is drawn up and if they want to adjust
                    something, they can also easily find it.
