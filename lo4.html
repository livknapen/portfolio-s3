                    To get a better overview of the awareness we want to make in
                    our project, we prepared “How Might We” questions. Because
                    of these questions, we have an overview of things we want to
                    aware the users of. With all these questions we ultimately
                    jointly developed two detailed questions that we will use

                    morning, we have a standup where everyone indicates what
                    they have done and will do. This allowed us to support each
                    other when necessary. I like to work with Trello, it is very
                    organized and in one blink you can see if something is done
                    or still in progress.
